cmudict-php
===========

PHP library for work with [CMU Pronouncing Dictionary](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict) (CMUdict).

With this class you can get the pronunciation of word in English.

The basis was taken out of class project [is-ottava-rima](https://github.com/cdmckay/is-ottava-rima) (unfortunately, it has not been updated since 2012). In fact, it is left unchanged - all the extra functionality is taken in the auxiliary class that extends the base class.
